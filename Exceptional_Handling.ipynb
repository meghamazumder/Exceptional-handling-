        "1.What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        " - **Interpreted languages** execute code line-by-line using an interpreter, making them easier to debug but slower in execution (e.g., Python, JavaScript).\n",
        "\n",
        " **Compiled languages** translate the entire code into machine code using a compiler before execution, making them faster but less flexible for quick testing (e.g., C, C++).\n",
        "\n",
        " 2.What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "  - **Exception handling** in Python is a mechanism to catch and manage runtime errors using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks, allowing the program to continue running without crashing.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3.What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "  - The **`finally` block** in exception handling is used to execute code **regardless of whether an exception occurred or not**, typically for cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "  4.What is logging in Python?\n",
        "  - **Logging** in Python is the process of recording messages during program execution using the `logging` module, which helps in tracking events, debugging, and monitoring applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "  5.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - The `__del__` method in Python is a **destructor** that is called when an object is about to be destroyed, allowing cleanup of resources like files or network connections before the object is removed from memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "  6.What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "  - - `import module` imports the whole module; you access functions with `module.function()`.  \n",
        "  - `from module import function` imports specific items directly; you can use `function()` without the module prefix.\n",
        "\n",
        "  7.How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "  - You can handle multiple exceptions in Python using:  \n",
        "  - **Multiple `except` blocks** for different exceptions.  \n",
        "  - A **single `except` block with a tuple** of exceptions: `except (TypeError, ValueError):`.\n",
        "\n",
        "  8.What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "  - The `with` statement ensures that a file is **automatically closed** after its block is executed, even if an exception occurs, making file handling **cleaner and safer**.\n",
        "\n",
        "  9.What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "  - **Multithreading** runs multiple threads within a single process, sharing memory and best for I/O-bound tasks.  \n",
        "  **Multiprocessing** runs multiple processes with separate memory, ideal for CPU-bound tasks to utilize multiple cores.\n",
        "\n",
        "  10.What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "  - **Advantages of using logging** in a program:  \n",
        "  - Tracks events and errors during execution  \n",
        "  - Helps in debugging and troubleshooting  \n",
        "  - Allows different log levels (INFO, ERROR, etc.)  \n",
        "  - Enables persistent logs for audits and analysis  \n",
        "  - Better than print statements for production code\n",
        "\n",
        "  11.What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "  - **Memory management** in Python involves automatically handling memory allocation and deallocation using a built-in garbage collector to manage unused objects, reducing the risk of memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "  12.What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "   - The basic steps in exception handling in Python are:  \n",
        "   1. **`try`**: Write code that may raise an exception.  \n",
        "   2. **`except`**: Catch and handle the exception.  \n",
        "   3. **`else`**: Execute code if no exception occurs.  \n",
        "   4. **`finally`**: Execute code that runs no matter what, typically for cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "   12.What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "    - The basic steps in exception handling in Python are:  \n",
        "    1. **`try`**: Block of code to test for exceptions.  \n",
        "    2. **`except`**: Block to handle the exception.  \n",
        "    3. **`else`**: Executes if no exception occurs.  \n",
        "    4. **`finally`**: Executes regardless of exceptions, typically for cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "    13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "    - Memory management in Python is important because it ensures efficient use of resources, prevents memory leaks, and automatically handles memory allocation and deallocation, improving program performance and stability.\n",
        "\n",
        "    14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "    - In exception handling, **`try`** defines a block of code that may raise an exception, while **`except`** catches and handles the exception if it occurs, allowing the program to continue running.\n",
        "\n",
        "    15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "    - Python's garbage collection system automatically manages memory by tracking object references. When an object's reference count drops to zero, it is marked for deletion. Python also uses a cyclic garbage collector to detect and clean up circular references.\n",
        "\n",
        "    16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "    -  The **`else`** block in exception handling runs only if no exception is raised in the **`try`** block, allowing you to execute code that should happen when the code in `try` succeeds.\n",
        "\n",
        "    17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "    - The common logging levels in Python are:  \n",
        "    1. **DEBUG**: Detailed information, typically for debugging.  \n",
        "    2. **INFO**: General information about program execution.  \n",
        "    3. **WARNING**: Indicates potential problems or unusual situations.  \n",
        "    4. **ERROR**: Indicates an error that occurred during execution.  \n",
        "    5. **CRITICAL**: Severe errors that may cause the program to crash.\n",
        "\n",
        "    18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "    - **`os.fork()`** creates a new child process by duplicating the parent process, mainly used in Unix-like systems, and shares the memory space between parent and child.\n",
        "\n",
        "    **`multiprocessing`** creates separate memory space for each process, allows parallel execution, and is cross-platform, providing a higher-level interface for process-based parallelism.\n",
        "\n",
        "    19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "    - Closing a file in Python is important to free up system resources, ensure data is properly saved, and prevent memory leaks or file corruption. It's best practice to use the `with` statement, which automatically closes the file after use.\n",
        "\n",
        "    20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "    - **`file.read()`** reads the entire content of the file as a single string.  \n",
        "    **`file.readline()`** reads one line at a time from the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "    21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "    - The **logging module** in Python is used to record log messages, helping with tracking events, debugging, and monitoring applications. It allows different log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, ERROR) and provides a flexible way to output logs to files, consoles, or external systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "    22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "    - The **`os` module** in Python is used for interacting with the operating system, providing functions for file handling tasks such as creating, deleting, renaming files, and navigating directories (e.g., `os.remove()`, `os.rename()`, `os.chdir()`).\n",
        "\n",
        "    23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "    - Challenges with memory management in Python include:  \n",
        "    1. **Garbage Collection Overhead**: The automatic garbage collector can impact performance, especially with large objects or circular references.  \n",
        "    2. **Memory Leaks**: Even though Python handles memory management, improper handling of references can lead to memory leaks.  \n",
        "    3. **Large Object Creation**: Handling large objects or datasets can consume significant memory, causing slowdowns or crashes if not managed properly.\n",
        "\n",
        "    24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "    - You can raise an exception manually in Python using the `raise` keyword, followed by the exception type:\n",
        "\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    raise Exception(\"Custom error message\")\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "    - Multithreading is important in certain applications to improve **performance** by allowing concurrent execution of tasks, especially for **I/O-bound operations** (e.g., file reading, network requests) without blocking the main program. It helps utilize system resources more efficiently.\n"
